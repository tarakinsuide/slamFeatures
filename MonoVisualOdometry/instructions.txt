Training

1. Find Camera calibration matrix and store the values 
2. Video to frames
3. Undistort the frames
4. Implement FAST algo for feature detection
5. Compare the current frame with the previous frame and implement KLT for feature tracking using Lucas Kanade Feature Tracker
6. Recalibrate if the number of features go below a threshold after tracking
7. Calculate Essential matrix (Find out why)
8. Handle outliers by using RANSAC
9. Compute Rotation matrix from essential matrix
10. Compute the trajectory
